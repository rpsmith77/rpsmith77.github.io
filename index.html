          <p><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a junior pursuing a software engineering degree at Florida Gulf Coast University. My projected graduation date is June 2022. In 2014 I had to leave my dream college, due to personal reasons, and I returned to school in 2018, after working a few years. I received my AA in general studies from Florida SouthWestern State College in the spring of 2019. Since then I have been attending FGCU. 
            <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an Engineering Ambassador for FGCU’s U.A. Whitaker College of Engineering, an active member of FGCU’s software engineering club, and spend most of my spare time as a learning assistant, helping COP 1500 Introduction to Computer Science students understand the basics of Python. My goal is to use my software engineering career to create a better world and help marginalized communities gain equality.

        <h2>Reflection on EGN 4930: Perspective Engineering Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This course was designed to provoke critical thinking, from its students, about the global challenges currently facing modern society and the role engineers have within it. Most of these issues, like global climate change, are well known, but it was interesting thinking about these issues from an engineer's perspective. Before this class, I had only thought about these issues from an everyday perspective. Taking this class during the pandemic added even more perspective to these issues. In the future, I will remember the importance of looking at these problems from an alternate perspective and remember that engineers have a vital role in fixing and preventing these issues.
        </p>
        <h3>Refelction on Each Topic Covered</h3>
        <h4>Sustainability</h4>
        <p>
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was what I considered to be the most important topic. The world is a ticking time bomb with climate change, and if we don’t do something about, fast, even more irreparable damage will be done. This topic showed me that even though this issue is urgent, it is vital to ensure these solutions are strong and long lasting. We learned about <a target="blank" href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/07/01/the-playpump-what-went-wrong/">play pumps</a> and how the best of intentions had negative effects on the communities they were installed in. The final thing I took away from this topic was that everyone has a role to play. While this issue can seem daunting and overwhelming, every little bit helps.
        </p>
        <h4>Health</h4>
        <p>
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This topic took a different approach than I thought it would. One assignment had us spit into teams that were either for or against bionics. I am for bionics and find the field fascinating, but I was on the team against bionics. By being on the team against, it broadened my view and brought up points I never would have considered, like inherent bias against impoverished people. Another assignment had us look at the cooking options for families in Tanzania. How the lack of infrastructure and poverty directly affected their health through the air quality. It had us try to come up with solutions to solve these issues in a realistic manner. Working within those constraints painted a new light on those struggles.
        </p>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This topic made me rethink what I thought about security. When I hear the word security, the first thing that pops in my mind is tall muscular people in dark sunglasses and earpieces, ready to pounce at any moment. Then I think about firewalls and encryption. This topic did talk about those things and it’s importance, but it also talked abou food security and how it effects peoples lives. This approach to security was new to me and reshaped how I thought about these issues. Food is a fundamental need, and when food isn’t secure, everyone suffers. Its a vicious cycle where the food secure countries have the wealth to subsidize and grow more food driving down the cost of food and stimulating the economy while countries that aren’t food secure have smaller economies because they can’t afford to buy much other than food.

        <h3>Future Solutions Final Project</h3>

          <embed src="SolarSoftwareposter.pdf" width="600" height="500" alt="pdf" pluginspage="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">
        </div>
        <p>
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a team assignment where my 3 teammates and I came up with a solution for a global issue. We decided to tackle global climate change by creating a solar power grid that meets 100% of power needs. The idea is to create a decentralized system that utilizes machine learning to predict future power needs and store power where appropriate. By making the system decentralized, natural disasters and other disruptions will have a minimal effect on other areas. The system will also have many of its parts replaceable by 3-D printed parts to allow for faster repair times. While the 4 of us do not, currently, have the skills to make this a reality, I don’t think this idea is science fiction. While I don’t think 100% of energy needs will be filled by solar, I do think solar will shortly have a massive expansion.
        </p> 
        <h3>Impact of Current Efforts to Solve Global Challenges Assignment</h3>

        <p>
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This assignment was designed to have us look at what engineers are currently doing to solve global issues. It showed me that the technology to solve these problems isn’t in the distant, utopian future, but rather being made now. One of them used an Arduino Uno R3 which I am using in one of my classes. It shows that I’m not too far from being able to make a real difference.
